  <p class="text">
    For our midterm project in the class of introduction to web design, we were asked to make a narrative or activist web intervention website. I decided to do my topic on juice boxes in a narrative form. A juice box is a small container where it
    contains a drink like juice, milk, etc. It’s a really convenient way to bring anywhere and just drink something on the go. Juice boxes are part of almost everyone’s childhood and it has a nostalgic aspect to it. It always came in our lunch boxes
    or as a small snack. The history of juice boxes all started when they wanted to find a more efficient and sanitary way to provide milk. The way milk was provided was really unsanitary, it was sold in a communal container and it would spread
    bacteria and disease. In the 1940s, a Swedish man called Rausing invented an innovative way to package milk. In order to keep the milk from spoiling, Rausing created the package so it won’t have any air except milk. This is when the Tetra Pak
    (packaging company) was created and it changed the whole industry. This new packaging method had many advantages like sanitary advantages, they could produce many quantities and preserve the quality for longer. It’s in 1974 that the first ever
    juice box was created. The packaging of a juice box is made out of a liquid packaging board. There’s a barrier coating which prevents the liquid from getting in touch with air. It’s also mainly in a small rectangular shape where it fits in the
    palm of your hand. Our modern juice box comes with an attached straw to it. It also has a small hole where you can easily poke a straw in it. There’s also a bigger version of a juice box where you could drink it multiple times rather than just a
    single serving drink. We have to admit Tetra Pak really changed the industry of packaging however they also have their mistakes. Environmental issues are a really big problem nowadays and their packaging is not environmentally friendly. Although
    the packaging has a low carbon footprint, they are not easily recycable. However, for many years Tetra Pak have tried to find different packaging alternatives to contribute to the environment but it is still a work in progress.They are also
    committed to doubling their global recycling. To conclude, for this website I wanted to make a sort of a museum of juice boxes. My approach is to make a narrative HTML where it would have a timeline about how juice boxes were created. I also
    wanted to make it interactive and make the home page a display of juice boxes and it would have history of all the different brands of juice boxes.
